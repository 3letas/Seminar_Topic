## Background:

Life is a sum of choices that we make because the choices that we make either make or mar us. A whole lot of those choices are influenced by our personalities. This means that for us to be able to predict the choices one is likely to make, we ought to be able to have an Understanding about their personality. Personality is the combination of an individualâ€™s behavior, emotion, motivation, and characteristics of their thought patterns. Our personality impacts a lot on our lives, affecting our life choices, mental health, well-being, and desires (Suman et al., 2022).

There are many technologies in the 21st century, but social media has had the greatest impact on the lives of most individuals, if not all. Social media has influenced our lives socially, politically and economically. As of October 2024, approximately 5.22 billion people globally were social media users, accounting for 63.8% of the world's population. On average, a typical user spends 2 hours and 19 minutes per day on social media (Datareportal, 2024). It is important to highlight that social media data doesn't emerge in a vacuum. Its interactions and engagement are often directly linked to, or even as a result of the events taking place outside the social media.(Quan-Haase & Sloan, 2022).Social media is a window into how people want to be seen and sometimes it is a mirror of their private lives. People often reveal what they are thinking about and certain traits about their personality through their post without even realizing. Social media usage has become an integral part of our daily lives, and the amount of data generated and stored is unprecedented. This data offers a rich source of information not only about the social world but also about the world at large, as it encompasses the interactions, opinions, attitudes, identity, intentions, and reactions of individuals to real-world events.

[Big Five Model and its application in personality prediction]

Facebook and Twitter stand out as two of the most valuable platforms for research on human behavior and personality, not just because of their large volume, with hundreds of millions to billions of users, but also due to the fact that they provide a diverse demographic of users. Unlike other platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram and Linkedin which focuses more on a particular type of content, Facebook and Twitter provides a richer and more diverse content, as well as interactions that makes them uniquely suited for studying and predicting personality.[Introduce the brief literature reviews here]
