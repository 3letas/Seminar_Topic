Most of our life decisons are driven by the desire to predict and choose the option that promises the best possible outcome. Since many of these decisions involve human interactions, we often aim to predict people's personalities in order to understand the situations that will lead to the most favorable outcomes for our choices. Significant amount of effort in research have been dedicated to understand human personalities, and this has led to the development of several useful models to explain these traits. Models like OCEAN, HEXACO, and others have been largely employed in human resources to asses the personality traits of job applicants, in marketing to create personalized products and services, and in mental health to better understand and manage the psychological, emotional and sociological well-being of individuals, just to name a few.


### Define personality prediction using the Big Five Personality Framework.

Lavi, Rosenblatt, and Gilead (2022) defined personality as the mental traits that distinguish individuals, shaping how they respond to different situations and can be used as a predictor of their behavior. Humans are complex beings, and as such, their personalities cannot be fully captured by any single model. However, specific models, such as the Big Five, have gained wide acceptance and have been successfully employed in the field of psychology. The Big Five Personality traits, also known as OCEAN, use five dimensions — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism — to describe personality traits.
