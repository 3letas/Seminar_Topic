## Background:

### Introduce the concept of personality prediction and its significance in various fields such as marketing, recruitment, and mental health.

Most of our life decisions are driven by the desire to predict and choose options that promise the best possible outcomes. Since many of these decisions involve human interactions, we often aim to predict people's personalities in a bid to better understand the situations likely to lead to the most favorable outcomes. A significant amount of research effort has been dedicated to understanding human personality, leading to the development of several useful models. Models such as OCEAN, HEXACO and MBTI have been widely used in human resources to assess job applicants' personality traits, in marketing to create personalized products and services, and in mental health to better understand and manage individuals' psychological, emotional, and social well-being.


### Define personality prediction using the Big Five Personality Framework.

Lavi, Rosenblatt, and Gilead (2022) defined personality as the mental traits that distinguish individuals, shaping how they respond to different situations and can be used as a predictor of their behavior. Humans are complex beings, and as such, their personalities cannot be fully captured by any single model. However, specific models, such as the Big Five, have gained wide acceptance and have been successfully employed in the field of psychology. The Big Five Personality traits, also known as OCEAN, use five dimensions — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism — to describe personality traits.

### Discuss the role of social media data in understanding human behavior.

"There are many technologies in the 21st century, but social media has had the greatest impact on the lives of most individuals, if not all. As of October 2024, approximately 5.22 billion people globally were social media users, accounting for 63.8% of the world's population. On average, a typical user spends 2 hours and 19 minutes per day on social media (Datareportal, 2024). These report highlight the profound influence that social media has had on our lives in this era.

"The beauty of social media is it provides a more cost-effective way to observe and analyze a large sample of human activities and behaviors than traditional measures, like surveying or interviewing a population” (Gong, 2020).
## Problem Statement:

### Highlight the challenges in leveraging cross-platform data for personality prediction. 

### Discuss limitations of single-platform studies and the need for data fusion from multiple sources.



## Research Objectives:

### Investigate how data from Facebook and Twitter can be fused for personality prediction.

### Assess the effectiveness of multi-platform data fusion in enhancing predictive accuracy.


## Scope:

### Focus on the Big Five Personality Framework.

### Study separate users from Facebook and Twitter rather than overlapping users.


## Methodology Overview:

### Briefly outline the data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques to be used.
