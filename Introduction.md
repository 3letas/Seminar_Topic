## Background:

### Introduce the concept of personality prediction and its significance in various fields such as marketing, recruitment, and mental health.

Most of our life decisions are driven by the desire to predict and choose options that promise the best possible outcomes. Since many of these decisions involve human interactions, we often aim to predict people's personalities in a bid to better understand the situations likely to lead to the most favorable outcomes. A significant amount of research effort has been dedicated to understanding human personality, leading to the development of several useful models. These models have been widely used in human resources to assess job applicants' personality traits, in marketing to create personalized products and services, and in mental health to better understand and manage individuals' psychological, emotional, and social well-being.


### Define personality prediction using the Big Five Personality Framework.

Lavi, Rosenblatt, and Gilead (2022) defined personality as the mental traits that distinguish individuals, shaping how they respond to different situations and can be used as a predictor of their behavior. Humans are complex beings, and as such, their personalities cannot be fully captured by any single model. Several frameworks, such as HEXACO, MBTI, and OCEAN, have been employed with machine algorithms to predict personality from social media data. However, the Big Five model has gained wide acceptance and has been successfully applied, especially in the field of psychology. The Big Five personality traits, also known as OCEAN, describe personality using five dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

### Discuss the role of social media data in understanding human behavior.

There are many technologies in the 21st century, but social media has had the greatest impact on the lives of most individuals, if not all. Social media has influenced our lives socially, politically and economically. As of October 2024, approximately 5.22 billion people globally were social media users, accounting for 63.8% of the world's population. On average, a typical user spends 2 hours and 19 minutes per day on social media (Datareportal, 2024). These report highlight the profound influence that social media has had on our lives in this era.

It is important to highlight that social media data doesn't emerge in a vacuum. Its interactions and engagement are often directly linked to, or even as a result of the events taking place outside the social media.(Quan-Haase & Sloan, 2022).Social media is a window into how people want to be seen and sometimes it is a mirror of their private lives. People often reveal what they are thinking about and certain traits about their personality through their post without even realizing. Social media usage has become an integral part of our daily lives, and the amount of data generated and stored is unprecedented. This data offers a rich source of information not only about the social world but also about the world at large, as it encompasses the interactions, opinions, attitudes, identity, intentions, and reactions of individuals to real-world events.

Facebook and Twitter stand out as two of the most valuable platforms for research on human behavior and personality, not just because of their large volume, with hundreds of millions to billions of users, but also due to the fact that they provide a diverse demographic of users. Unlike other platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram and Linkedin that are focuses more on a particular type of content, information or community, Facebook and Twitter provides a richer and more diverse content, as well as interactions that makes them uniquely suited for studying and predicting personality.
## Problem Statement:

### Highlight the challenges in leveraging cross-platform data for personality prediction. 

### Discuss limitations of single-platform studies and the need for data fusion from multiple sources.



## Research Objectives:

### Investigate how data from Facebook and Twitter can be fused for personality prediction.

### Assess the effectiveness of multi-platform data fusion in enhancing predictive accuracy.


## Scope:

### Focus on the Big Five Personality Framework.

### Study separate users from Facebook and Twitter rather than overlapping users.


## Methodology Overview:

### Briefly outline the data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques to be used.
