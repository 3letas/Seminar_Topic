## Background
Social media is a window into how people want to be seen and sometimes it is a mirror of their private lives. It is a place where people reveal personal details and insights about their lives. Social media has influenced our lives socially, politically, and economically. As of October 2024, approximately 5.22 billion people globally were social media users, accounting for 63.8% of the world's population. On average, a typical user spends 2 hours and 19 minutes per day on social media (Datareportal, 2024). 

It is important to highlight that social media data doesn't emerge in a vacuum. Its interactions and engagement are often directly linked to, or even as a result of the events taking place outside the social media. (Quan-Haase & Sloan, 2022). People often reveal what they are thinking about and certain traits about their personality through their posts without even realizing it. Social media usage has become an integral part of our daily lives, and the amount of data generated and stored is unprecedented. This data offers a rich source of information not only about the social world but also about the world at large, as it encompasses the interactions, opinions, attitudes, identities, intentions, and reactions of individuals to real-world events. 

While there are several social media platforms in use today, Facebook and Twitter stand out as two of the most valuable platforms for research on human behavior and personality, not just because of their large volume, with hundreds of millions to billions of users, but also because they provide a diverse demographic of users. Unlike other platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, and Linkedin which focus more on a particular type of content, both platforms provide richer and more diverse content, as well as interactions that make them uniquely suited for use in understanding and predicting personality traits.

Personality traits reflect peopleâ€™s characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Among the commonly used frameworks for predicting personality traits, the Big Five Model also known as OCEAN has marked a point of no return in the field of personality psychology. This model has been popularly endorsed as a relevant and reliable framework for identifying and categorizing psychological traits namely: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Extraversion describes individuals who are outgoing, sociable, energetic, and enthusiastic. The Agreeableness dimension describes individuals who are cooperative and patient with a willingness to respond to others. Conscientiousness is a trait that is most attuned to individuals who are detailed, well-organized, and productive.  Openness describes individuals with traits of curiosity, creativity, and novelty. Neuroticism describes individuals who have a tendency towards emotional instability and negative emotions.

Maharani & Effendy (2022) found a strong correlation between the emotional features of Twitter users from Indonesia and their personality types. They proposed that increasing the dataset with more participants and a wider range of user profiles would improve prediction accuracy. Facebook tends to portray people as more tame, culturally and socially acceptable individuals than they are. Twitter on the other hand, tends to offer users the privilege of anonymity, allowing them to express themselves more freely. They do not need to connect with friends and family to feel included, leading to more raw and unfiltered engagements. Since most existing studies focus on analyzing data from a single platform, such as Facebook or Twitter, which limits the accuracy and generalizability of personality prediction models. This study seeks to address this gap by integrating data from Facebook and Twitter, aiming to significantly increase the size of datasets, reduce data bias, and therefore enhance the accuracy of personality prediction models.
